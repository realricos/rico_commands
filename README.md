The following functions with script is :

/bring id   --  Which makes it easy for staff to teleport someone to themselves.

/noclip     -- This command has been customized with a realistic noclip functions to look similar in what you see in the daily swedish FiveM Servers.

/toggle id  -- This command has been made for those who want their staff to not use txAdmin Show ID. 
                A cool feature is when the player talks the name switches colour to green when they talk and switches back to normal when not talking.
