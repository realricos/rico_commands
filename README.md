# Rico Commands

This scripts contains a set of simple commands for users of the qb-core framework for their servers.

## Commands

The following commands are included in this script:

- `/goto id` - Allows staff to teleport to a specific player ID.
- `/bring id` - Allows staff to teleport a player to themselves.
- `/noclip` - Provides a realistic noclip function similar to those seen in Swedish FiveM servers.
- `/toggle id` - Allows staff to toggle the visibility of player IDs without using txAdmin Show ID. When the player talks, their name switches to green and reverts to normal when not talking.
- `/spawnveh` - Spawns a car with the license plate "ADMIN" and gives the key to the player. This command supports servers using the Quasar vehicle keys system. To enable support for `qs-vehiclekeys`, uncomment line 9 in `fxmanifest.lua`.

## Customization

You can modify the commands to suit your needs and add additional functionality as desired.
